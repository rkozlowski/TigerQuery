# TigerQuery

**TigerQuery** is a lightweight SQL script engine and parser built for compatibility with `sqlcmd` and SSMS SqlCmd mode — but with cleaner, safer behavior and a test-driven foundation.

It powers `tiger-sqlcmd`, a modern CLI for executing complex `.sql` scripts with repeatable batches, variable injection, and advanced scripting features.

---

## 🧠 Philosophy

**TigerQuery is not a clone of sqlcmd.**  
It’s a deliberate reimplementation — compatible where it matters, safer where it should be, and documented with precision.

Unlike sqlcmd or SSMS, TigerQuery:

- Has a dedicated, composable parser
- Tracks batch structure and execution metadata
- Is fully test-covered and intentionally divergent where appropriate

---

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Compatible `:setvar`, `$(var)`, `:on error`, `GO [n]` handling
- ✅ Fully async parser and execution engine
- ✅ Tracks exact line/column metadata per batch
- ✅ Structured error handling via `TigerQueryException`
- ✅ Differentiates between `sqlcmd`, `sqlcmdex`, and normal modes
- ✅ Easily embeddable in CLI tools or .NET apps

---

## 🧪 Tests = Documentation

TigerQuery uses a structured unit test suite to document:

- 🔍 Known compatibility issues  
- 💡 Intentional differences from `sqlcmd` or SSMS  
- 🧪 Parser edge cases, whitespace behavior, comment handling  
- 🧠 Design decisions that prioritize clarity over legacy quirks

See:

- [`SqlCmdParserKnownIssues`](ItTiger.TigerQuery.Tests/Parser/SqlCmdParserKnownIssues.cs)  
- [`SqlCmdParserIntentionalDifferences`](ItTiger.TigerQuery.Tests/Parser/SqlCmdParserIntentionalDifferences.cs)

## 🚀 Quickstart with tiger-sqlcmd

```bash
tiger-sqlcmd run -c local -m sqlcmdex -f script.sql
```

Here, `local` is a saved connection managed with `tiger-sqlcmd connections`.
The `run` command supports `-v name=value` for variables, `--verbosity`,
`--log-level`, and more.
